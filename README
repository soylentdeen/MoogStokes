                 Release 1.00

---------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you for downloading the MOOGStokes extention to the MOOG spectral
synthesis program.  This tarball is a fully-functional version of MOOG 
derived from the February 2013 version (MOOG2013.tar.gz) available on 
Chris Sneden's website (http://www.as.utexas.edu/~chris/moog.html)

Version 1.0 of the MoogStokes package is described in a methods paper in the
Astronomical Journal (2013)

Contents
====================================
The tarball contains all files necessary for a fully-functional verions of
MOOG, including the MoogStokes extension.  In addition to the MOOG-specific
files, the MOOGStokes tarball also includes the following original
MOOGStokes-specific files:

Angles.com
CalcGeom.f
CalcOpacities.f
ComplexVoigt.f
Curfit.f
DELOQuad.f
GridStokes.f
Makefile.MoogStokesMac
Makefile.MoogStokesMacsilent
Makefile.MoogStokes64
Makefile.MoogStokes64silent
Makefile.MoogStokes
Makefile.MoogStokessilent
MoogStokes.f
MoogStokessilent.f
SplineDriver.f
Spline.f
Stokes.com
SynStokes.f
Wavegrid.f

The tarball also includes slightly modified versions of the following MOOG-
specific files:

Atmos.com
Inlines.f
Linex.com
Params.f
Synth.f

The differences between the original MOOG2013 files and the new versions can
be found in differences.txt

Dependencies
=====================================
In addition to the X11 and Supermongo libraries, MoogStokes also relies upon the
following linear algebra packages:

ATLAS (http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/)
LAPACK (http://www.netlib.org/lapack/)

Make sure you have these libraries installed on your system

Installation Instructions
=====================================
1) untar the MOOGStokes.tar.gz in a suitable directory (e.g. /home/user/Codes/Moog/)
2) Modify the appropriate path and machine-type in MoogStokes.f or MoogStokessilent.f.
     For the original version of Moog, modify instead Moog.f or Moogsilent.f
3) Modify the Makefile according to your installation.  Make sure you have the correct
     directories for the ATLAS and LAPACK libraries.
4) compile MoogStokes

      > make -f Makefile.MoogStokesXXX  (where XXX is the appropiate make file)

Alternatively, you can try to install MoogStokes via a python-based 
installer adapted from Andy Casey's MOOG installer.  The python installer can
be downloaded from https://github.com/Acetylene5/moog/archive/master.zip.

Simply download and unzip the file, and follow the instructions in the README
file.

This will make the MoogStokes (or MoogStokessilent) executable.

SynStokes.f
=====================================

The SynStokes MOOG driver is modeled after the Synth driver.  However, there
are a few important differences between Synth and SynStokes.

First, Synth saves its spectra in a data file specified by the 'smoothed_out'
parameter.  Because SynStokes calculates the Stokes vectors at multiple
locations across the stellar disk, it is impractical to save all emergent 
Stokes vectors at all locations in a single file.  Instead, SynStokes
saves the output spectra in several files.  The several files have a common
base file name, which is specified in the parameter 'stokes_out'.  SynStokes
then appends endings to this base file name in the following manner:

basename.angles
basename.spectrum_I
basename.spectrum_Q
basename.spectrum_U
basename.spectrum_V
basename.continuum

.angles
----------------
the .angles file contains geometrical information regarding each emergent
spectrum.  The format of the .angles file depends on the chosen disk-integration
algorithm.  If using the annular disk integration method of Valenti & Piskunov
(diskflag == 1), then the .angles files consists of n lines (where n is the 
number of annuli into which the stellar disk is divided), each containing the
following information:

i, phi_angle(i), mu(i)

i is the annulus index,
phi_angle(i) is the longitudinal angle on the star of the ith annulus
     (measured so that the center of the stellar disk has a phi_angle of 0.0)
mu(i) is the viewing angle of the ith annulus at the disk equator.
     (taken to be the cosine of the phi_angle)

If instead, the diskflag parameter is set to 0, SynStokes divides the stellar
surface into a number of regions (similar to Figure 5 in Piskunov & Kochukhov
(2002)).  In this case, the .angles files is formatted slightly differently.
The first line contains 4 numbers:

ncells, nrings, inclination, position_angle

where ncells is the number of (approximately) equal area tiles into which
the surface is divided.  nrings is the number of latitude belts.  inclination
and position angle refer to the orientation of the stellar rotation axis
on the sky, and are given in radians.

the next ncell lines contain 9 columns each.  The columns are defined as:

Column | variable | description
----------------------------------------
  1    |    i     |   tile index
  2    |    az    |   azimuthal angle of center of tile
  3    | az_start |   azimuthal angle of northern edge of tile
  4    | az_stop  |   azimuthal angle of southern edge of tile
  5    |  long    |   Longitude of center of tile
  6    | d_long   |   angular width of tile in longitude direction
  7    | phi_ang  |   Phi angle of the center of the tile
  8    | chi_ang  |   Chi angle of the center of the tile
  9    |  mu      |   viewing angle of the center of the tile.

.spectrum_I(QUV)
--------------------
The .spectrum files contain all the emergent spectra calculated by SynStokes.
The .spectrum_I/Q/U/V file contains the emergent Stokes I/Q/U/V flux
calculated at each location described in the .angles file.  Each file is
formatted so that there are ncells+1 columns, and the number of lines in each 
file depends upon the number of wavelength points in the spectrum.  A typical
line in a .spectrum file is formatted as such:

lambda1 f_lambda1_pos1 f_lambda1_pos2 ... ... f_lambda1_pos_ncells
lambda2 f_lambda2_pos1 f_lambda2_pos2 ... ... f_lambda2_pos_ncells
...
...
lambdaN f_lambdaN_pos1 f_lambdaN_pos2 ... ... f_lambdaN_pos_ncells

.continuum
-------------------
The .continuum file is formatted in the same manner as the .spectrum_ files, 
but instead of emergent Stokes flux, contains the emergent continuum.  The user
can create a normalized spectrum by dividing the I, Q, U, and V spectra by
the continuum.

The post-processing python script "Diskoball" can read in the data products
produced by SynStokes and perform the disk integration necessary to compare
to observations.  Diskoball can be obtained from the author, or from the 
github repository.

Troubleshooting
=====================================
1) The linker is complaining about not being able to find super-mongo-specific procedures
(i.e. "Specplot.f:313: undefined reference to `sm_limits_'")

 A) I have found this is a combination of the SM compilation and gfortran compiler.  Try
adding the -fsecond-underscore option to the compiler options
         (e.g.: FC = gfortran -Wall -g -std=legacy -fsecond-underscore)

2) More to come....
